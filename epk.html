                        When their singer was sent to prison for murder in 2015, the breakout L.A. hardcore metal outfit Salvage 67 went into shocked paralysis. A hiatus followed while its members processed the horror and heartache of the terrible event.
                        <br/><br/>
                        But the band returned, inspired by the experience and the emotions it triggered. Founders <em>James Wilinski</em>, drummer, and <em>Travis Hildreth</em>, guitarist, who had been playing together for years, remained anchors of the band throughout tumultuous lineup changes. In 2017, they rebranded as <em>Second Shooter</em>. The band further developed their unique sound when guitarist <em>Wynn McElwee</em> and vocalist <em>Melanie Johnson</em> joined in 2018. The final piece locked into place with the addition of <em>Jeff Clark</em> on bass. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        After a flurry of writing and dedicated playing, they released their debut EP in December of 2018. Second Shooter makes uncompromising music that combines classic metal, prog, hardcore, and death metal. Drawing on the tragedy, chaos, and betrayals that have become day-to-day life, it is catharsis focused into an unstoppable sonic force.
