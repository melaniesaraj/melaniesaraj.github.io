                    When their singer was sent to prison for murder in 2015, breakout L.A. hardcore metal outfit Savage 67 went into shocked paralysis. A hiatus followed while its members processed the surreal horror and heartache of the news.

                    But the band returned, inspired by the experience and the emotions triggered by these events. Founders James Wilinski, drummer, and Travis Hildreth, guitarist, who had been playing together for years, remained anchors of the band throughout tumultuous lineup changes. In 2017, they rebranded as Second Shooter. They further developed their already unique sound in 2018 with the arrival of guitarist Wynn McElwee and vocalist Melanie Johnson, and the final piece locked into place with the addition of Jeff Clark on bass.

                    Following a flurry of frenzied writing and recording, they released their debut EP in December of 2018, followed by a riotous first show at L.A.’s legendary Whisky a Go-Go (opening for genre godfather Phil Anselmo).

                    Second Shooter makes uncompromising music that combines classic metal, prog, hardcore, and death metal, all channeled through Johnson’s distinctive screams and thoughtful lyrics. Already being compared to the diverse likes of Meshuggah, Suicidal Tendencies, Pantera, and Korn, Second Shooter draws upon the tragedy, chaos and betrayals of everyday life to create universal human catharsis focused into an unstoppable sonic force.
